        web team here at Canonical run two-week iterations. Here are some of the highlights
        of our completed work from this iteration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meet the team<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#x1f44b;
        My name is Sam, and I am a project manager on the web team.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I
        help run a few of our squads in the web team. The web squad, vanilla squad
        and the brand squad. This means I get to see how different disciplines work
        and help them form plans to achieve their objectives. I really enjoy seeing
        squad members work well together to get stuff done!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before
        I came to Canonical, I worked in a small branding studio, working on a range
        of different projects, from digital brand hierarchies to cold-brew labels!&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When
        I am not being a project manager I like to unwind by cooking something a bit
        bougie or by playing games on my PS4.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Web squad<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our
        Web Squad develops and maintains most of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/search?q=topic%3Awebsite+org%3Acanonical-web-and-design&amp;type=Repositories\">Canonical\u2019s

        new \u201cWhat is Kubernetes\u201d page<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the success
        of our other popular \u201cWhat is\u201d pages, we created one for Kubernetes.
        It explains a bit of the history of the project, who the main contributors
        are and the key concepts and terms around the Kubernetes project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        sprint<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A few of us spent some time this week focusing on the
        testing across 100+ projects to work on standardisation and improvements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Standardise
        automated checks (CI)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been gradually migrating our
        projects to use GitHub Actions, as they are better integrated into GitHub
        where we do most of our work. This week, we migrated many of our projects
        from CircleCI and Travis to GitHub Actions, and we will be continuing to hopefully
        move everything in the coming weeks.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also updated the
        recommended checks in our <a href=\"https:\/\/canonical-web-and-design.github.io\/practices\/workflow\/automated-checks.html\">automated
        checks standard<\/a> and we added these standard checks to many more projects.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>JavaScript pipeline and test coverage<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve
        started to standardise our JavaScript build pipeline across all (non-React)
        projects, around webpack. This pipeline includes a framework for testing and
        reporting coverage with codecov.io.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We added structure
        to many of our website projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Linkchecker<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We
        have been using <a href=\"http:\/\/manpages.ubuntu.com\/manpages\/cosmic\/man1\/linkchecker.1.html\">linkchecker<\/a>
        for a while to check both internal and external links <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/ubuntu.com\/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Links+in+master%22\">on
        ubuntu.com<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, we considered how to expand
        this to other websites. We decided we should automatically collect information
        about broken links in a spreadsheet. To help with this, we wrote our first
        GitHub Action &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/marketplace\/actions\/google-spreadsheet-csv-importer\">Google
        Spreadsheet CSV importer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ubuntu advantage renewals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Renewals
        functionality released<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We released the ability to renew existing
        enterprise subscriptions via <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/advantage\">the
        advantage dashboard<\/a>. When a subscription is soon to expire, customers
        will receive an email notification directing them to the dashboard, where
        they\u2019ll be able to process a payment directly.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        project represents a huge amount of work and collaboration from teams across
        the company, and is the first step towards a larger ecommerce experience on
        the Ubuntu Advantage dashboard.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Future design vision for
        renewals<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to visually build up your fleet subscription
        in a simple UI and purchase support easily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brand<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Brand team develop our design strategy and create the look and feel for the
        company across many touch-points, from web, documents, exhibitions, logos
        and video.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Document Hierarchy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We progressed
        our document hierarchy work by applying our initial investigations into design
        prototypes, experimenting with the amount of branding applied to different
        documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-IAdmyGdq7D_jUlXzipFNu7uhG6PbRoRuYs2_719tHafNVXqNXzhLyFpc_UzohSCOqm7puzufukxBqKrlyjbMGiHaPDsNla8HN1uwQsO1c9z8JKP1XnWd1hKKfi06IyJ2T8NhpkI\"

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey to discover how to improve MAAS.io
        is still ongoing! Last week after trying to determine the current user journey
        for our Technical Writers, this week we are exploring the behavior of our
        Documentation readers. We have currently just identified two search behavior
        patterns such as transactional search behavior and contextual search behavior.
        The difference between the 2 is that transactional searches are on point searches,
        for people who are familiar with the concept and only needed examples. The
        latter one describes the behavior of users whose goal is to understand the
        big picture concept.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is how does this search
        behavior impact our current design and how might we help our users search
        and navigate to the content that they are looking for easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UX
        exploration into mini graphs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The team are aiming to tackle
        a refresh of the KVM section of MAAS and part of that is the in table mini
        graphs to give a summary of usage across the machines.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After
        reviewing a number of users across the company the findings show that many
        people thought the mini graphs were just an estimated summary and not an absolute
        representation of the allocation of resources.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        main question was did people understand the representation of overcommitted
        values. Many needed to view the tooltip on hover to understand what the different
        borders represented.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This research has led us to
        three options which will be iterated on.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        the search and filtering UX<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this cycle, our team is implementing
        the Combo Search and filter pattern on the Juju Dashboard, where both search
        and filtering functions could be performed on one bar. The user can pick the
        filter chips from a menu, or type and submit direct keywords to query the
        table data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Filtering result as a chip added<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking
        on the search bar will activate the pattern, a menu with categories and available
        filter chips will show. The user can select and de-select chips from the menu,
        selected ones will be applied as filters and shown in the search bar. The
        table will be filtered as soon as a filter is applied, no extra submission
        needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/l92EVqKhdEFdg5zOwXHuZo-l_bK10vXNzJmenmXO939CcHEZOTgLBavrsU_fMSe9EvOaH1947YeTv4qYBMWAuYAhiN44Uq7kzfOww8FDjKTEdvrBnvpI90oSnlp7IpyfoP7MLZfB\"

        as a chip<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the user starts typing and hit \u2018enter\u2019
        to submit a keyword chip (e.g. \u2018cl\u2019 in the example), the table will
        be filtered to models containing data with matched characters \u2018cl\u2019
        from the beginning of the word (e.g. \u2018claudio\u2019, \u2018clive\u2019
        but not \u2018accli\u2019).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filtered table will highlight
        the matched characters in bold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        an \u2018expandable indicator\u2019 formatted as \u2018+2\u2019, when on click

        are many ways one can go about building snaps. You can do it on your local
        system, by manually running commands in a terminal window. If you have a developer
        account in the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/store\">Snap Store<\/a>,
        you can use the integrated build functionality to create snaps. You can also
        use Launchpad, Electron Builder or a range of CI\/CD systems. And you can
        also run your own, self-hosted snap building factory!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Setting
        up shop<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/fabrica\">Fabrica<\/a>
        is a brand new, early development, locally hosted Web service designed to
        help developers build snaps. The idea behind Fabrica is simple and clever.
        You get an automated system that can hook up remote repositories and build
        snaps whenever there is a change in the source tree. This way, you can manage
        multiple projects and generate up-to-date builds, with little to no interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fabrica
        consists of two layers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A simple Web UI that allows you
        to add an unlimited number of publicly available, clonable Git trees. You
        can choose different (or multiple) branches for each tree.<\/li><li>Under
        the hood, Fabrica runs the LXD container service, which spawns container instances,
        inside which the Git trees are cloned and snaps built. You can then \u201cdownload\u201d
        the built snaps, test and use them.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Fabrica prerequisites<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        first step is to install and configure the LXD service on your system. If
        you already have it, then you can skip this step. If not, you should install
        the LXD snap, and go through the first-time setup wizard on the command line.
        For most users, the default options will work just fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap install lxd<br>sudo lxd init<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once
        the LXD component is set up, you can install Fabrica:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap
        install fabrica<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After the snap is installed, you will need
        to do just a tiny bit of manual work. Snaps are designed to be self-contained
        applications, with strong security and isolation from the underlying system
        and other software running on it. Granular access to system resources is possible
        through a mechanism called <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/interface-management\">interfaces<\/a>.
        Some interfaces are <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/supported-interfaces\">auto-connected<\/a>;
        when you install a snap, the requested resources are provisioned automatically.
        Some, for security reasons, are not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this particular case,
        you will need to grant Fabrica permission to access the LXD service, mount-observe
        (read mount table and quota information), and system-observe (read process
        and system information).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap

        the connection is available via HTTP, and there is no secure tunnel or authentication,
        which means you ought to test and run this service over trusted networks only.
        As a project in development, it should receive new features and capabilities
        in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/Y0_uH2nlN5KD2wsMoubdHJPIPQ4TtwlthX8SVDWjyUPb49X7iJ_z7Ouis9lmAayyk12xnaCzGgp_gIgT8gKVQvkqhwrxUJH69ajTR2JPV047kkXzXDvd0gW59Ob0_JZ0uFTXhX6z\"

        people looking for a largely hands-free setup to automate their snaps builds,
        Fabrica offers a simple, convenient solution. It is not designed to replace
        the existing methods; instead, it complements the robust build and integration
        mechanisms already in place, and offers yet another practical toolbox to developers
        and enthusiastic users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, some options and features are
        currently unavailable, like perhaps authentication or customizable build trigger
        period, but this is where you come in! Grab Fabrica and run your own tests,
        and if you have any recommendations or suggestions, please join our forum,

        its participation in the 9th OSM Hackfest with a renewed sense of fellowship
        with the Open Source MANO (<a href=\"https:\/\/osm.etsi.org\/\">OSM<\/a>)
        community and great pride in the collaborative work that enabled an end-to-end
        mobile network orchestration demo using OSM\u2019s model-driven capabilities
        to onboard network services. Following the successful organisation of the
        previous hackfest in Madrid in March, this week\u2019s hackfest was held in
        a remote format, with greater attendance, as OSM is becoming an increasingly
        advanced project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>OSM#9 hackfest: new format<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        this hackfest, the organisers decided to change the structure in a way that
        would facilitate hands-on sessions; with attendees playing with technology
        to learn and unlock new capabilities and skills &#8211; staying true to the
        very nature of a hackfest The event spanned three days of theory and workshop
        sessions, with an extra day for ecosystem-related presentations and leadership,
        and technical sessions happening in a parallel track for the full week.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        overall experience was great with active participation and every session felt
        like adding a piece to the puzzle to highlight the benefits that OSM can bring
        to telcos in a landscape that is rapidly moving towards network function virtualisation
        and containerisation. Participants were introduced to the end-to-end hackfest
        scenario on the first day. The next two days were all about how to deploy
        and operate network functions on physical machines (PNFs), virtual machines
        (VNFs) and Kubernetes-managed containers (KNFs), and how to do network slicing,
        auto-scaling and testing. Slides from all sessions can be found on the <a

        at the OSM#9 Hackfest<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical\u2019s OSM team was fully
        present at the hackfest, both as session presenters and as participants to
        the leadership and technical sessions. Mark Beierl, the <a href=\"https:\/\/osm.etsi.org\/wiki\/index.php\/DEVOPS_MDG#MDG_Lead\">OSM
        DevOps module design lead<\/a> (MDL), drove the day 1 session that introduced
        the hackfest scenario. The scenario used <a href=\"http:\/\/magma\">Facebook\u2019s
        Magma<\/a> opensource mobile network solution and linked it to OSM to demonstrate
        its management and orchestration (MANO) capabilities.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David
        Garcia, the <a href=\"https:\/\/osm.etsi.org\/wiki\/index.php\/N2VC_MDG#MDG_Lead\">N2VC
        MDL<\/a>, started day 2 with an introduction to OSM\u2019s orchestration actions,
        or primitives as these are referred to by telcos. OSM leverages Juju charms\u2019
        model-driven approach to drive lifecycle management, workload configuration,
        daily operations and integration functions.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 2
        continued with Garcia leading two workshops on VNF and PNF onboarding using
        charms. Removing operational complexity is not the only benefit of charms.
        Charms allow reuse of the same code to drive operations on multiple substrates,
        something that can be very common in telecommunications, with most vendors
        having to deal with legacy infrastructure alongside virtualised datacenters
        and software-defined solutions. Day 2 wrapped up with a workshop on KNF onboarding,
        led by Dominik Fleischmann from Canonical, that showcased the use of charms
        to onboard network functions on containers.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        presence at the OSM#9 Hackfest was concluded on day 4 with an interactive
        session led by Product Manager, Alex Chalkias. This \u2018OSM in Production\u2019
        session, in line with the overall vision of the OSM community for a production-grade
        OSM, was a brainstorm to address feedback from the field and telco requirements
        in production environments, such as high availability, security, geo-redundancy
        and disaster recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leadership and technical sessions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical
        has a strong presence in the OSM leadership team, with CEO Mark Shuttleworth
        being a technical steering committee (TSC) member plus Beierl and Garcia from
        Canonical\u2019s OSM engineering team as MDLs. Canonical\u2019s vision is
        to bring better economics for data centres by providing smarter operations
        at a better price. This vision is very appealing to telecommunications providers
        that face complex network operations at scale. Our engagement in OSM aims
        at driving comprehensive design choices to drive better code and operations.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During
        the technical sessions, we presented the latest version of the OSM installer.
        The installer is able to deploy OSM using upstream OSM charms in high-availability
        mode on a user-provided Kubernetes, bootstrap a <a href=\"https:\/\/linuxcontainers.org\/lxd\/introduction\/?_ga=2.94841052.1362005860.1591288070-1111960603.1582207214\">LXD
        cluster<\/a> and link it to a virtual infrastructure manager (VIM) such as
        an Openstack cloud. Similarly, the installer can deploy OSM on a single-node,
        using <a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/\">Microk8s<\/a> as the K8s substrate.
        The technical sessions also addressed the roadmap plan for OSM Release EIGHT
        that should be available in July 2020 and defined upcoming features to address
        production readiness. This marks an inflection point in OSM as the project
        enters a more mature stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The OSM Ecosystem Day sessions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An
        essential part of every OSM hackfest, the <a href=\"https:\/\/osm.etsi.org\/wikipub\/index.php\/OSM9_Hackfest#OSM_Ecosystem_Day\">Ecosystem
        Day<\/a> is an opportunity for the community to learn about vendor-oriented
        solutions and projects. This time we learned more about network slicing, service
        assurance and the shift towards a 5G Open Core for Telco NFV. We also presented
        a session about OSM production readiness that neatly tied up with the previous
        production-focused discussions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>OSM#9 Hackfest: Key
        takeaway<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the OSM project moves forward towards production,
        the ecosystem is able to acknowledge its strengths and weaknesses. The community
        is now better positioned than ever to improve the former and address the latter
        to make OSM a key component in the telco NFV landscape.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        next hackfest date and content are yet to be finalised, with September 7-11th
        being the most plausible timeframe. We will be looking forward to seeing you
        there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/charmed-osm.com\/\">Learn more about

        of the Month<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you noticed how many robots simulate
        real-life creatures? Not only does biology lend itself to inspiration in robot
        design, it also provides us with a finely tuned, optimized model to emulate.
        The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.memmo-project.eu\/\">Memory of Motion (memmo)
        project<\/a> is an example of biomimicry in robotics. Specifically, in this
        case, complex movements in unstructured environments are planned using the
        cognitive principles from human biology.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\"

        plans are pre-computed offline, and then recalled when needed in real-time
        training. Training feeds back on continued optimisation of the motion plans.
        This planning workflow follows the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Situation_awareness\">cognitive
        model for human situational awareness<\/a> where training and experience is
        used to create models, and models speed selection of actions to drive towards
        a goal.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The snappy TurtleBot continues<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical

        Francisco based startup Freedom Robotics announced Link ROS, which is their
        take on a tool for cloud logging, data visualization, and tele-operation for
        robotics. It enables viewing data coming from ROS 1 or 2, and controlling
        robots from anywhere in the world, even with choppy internet connectivity.

        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In my last post, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/migrating-the-maas-ui-from-angularjs-to-react\">Migrating
        the MAAS UI from AngularJS to React<\/a>, I touched upon our decision to avoid
        building a single hybridised UI using tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/coatue-oss\/react2angular\">react2angular<\/a>
        and instead create a new react-redux application. This was the correct decision
        in retrospect, however it poses some new challenges, particularly around ensuring
        good user experience while navigating between both React and AngularJS apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Single-spa<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        order to provide a single, unified experience as we continue our migration
        to React beyond the new machine list, we\u2019ve employed a framework called
        <a href=\"https:\/\/single-spa.js.org\/\">single-spa<\/a>, \u201ca javascript
        router for front-end microservices\u201d. Single-spa allows us to create a
        single production build for the MAAS UI, while preserving our independent
        React and AngularJS projects, each with their own distinct codebase, build,
        configuration and CI.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/IzX7IQ4RPPFHXbKGQqHVzDfqjyNuy-krEvDWuRgLmBsQ_-edwt024DGtzI7oc5G6DMI8mC4U5EymDfZBSWVjQrqVr_-eF1nx_l51tqoyDjs1ANpysKo0RAiYUj836Ow3DqxULbii\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As users navigate between React and AngularJS
        routes in the MAAS UI, each respective app is lazily loaded. Once loaded,
        both apps remain in memory, and navigating between the two feels relatively
        seamless without any loss of state.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Single-spa was originally
        conceived to address essentially the same issue that MAAS faces, a means of
        migrating from a legacy AngularJS monolith to an AngularJS and React polyglot
        application. Since then, it has grown in scope to provide tooling for building
        <a href=\"https:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/micro-frontends.html\">frontend
        microservices<\/a>. Frontend microservices, or <a href=\"https:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/micro-frontends.html\">micro-frontends<\/a>
        are an advanced architectural pattern, allowing for independent deployment
        and scaling of web application development across disparate teams. Many of
        the benefits conferred by micro-frontends are not relevant for MAAS, which
        our simpler use of single-spa reflects.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Migrating our
        apps to single-spa<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Single-spa delivers on its promise, however
        adopting it for an existing application can be a complex process as the tools
        are flexible and support a variety of build and deployment scenarios. New
        applications, particularly those wanting to adopt the frontend microservices
        pattern, should consider using the <a href=\"https:\/\/single-spa.js.org\/docs\/recommended-setup\">recommended
        setup<\/a> with the SystemJS module loader and the <a href=\"https:\/\/single-spa.js.org\/docs\/create-single-spa\/\">create-single-spa<\/a>
        cli tool. SystemJS allows for importing of independently deployed bundles
        via an import map, a map of import names to urls. As MAAS is a packaged product,
        rather than a publically deployed web service, we choose not to introduce
        this additional complexity and instead import modules directly from within
        our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/maas-ui\/\">monorepo<\/a>.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Single-spa
        introduces lifecycle events such as mounting and unmounting of applications,
        similar to those in React, and provides helper libraries for popular frameworks
        to make your applications lifecycle aware (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/single-spa\/single-spa-angularjs\">single-spa-angularjs<\/a>,
        <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/single-spa\/single-spa-react\">single-spa-react<\/a>).
        While implementing single-spa lifecycle functions are straightforward, changes
        to your build to support single-spa can be complex, particularly if you\u2019re
        using <a href=\"https:\/\/create-react-app.dev\/\">create-react-app<\/a>.
        Additionally, single-spa applications are html-less, and the lack of an <em>index.html<\/em>
        to bootstrap your application may mean a bit of leg-work to get css, fonts
        and external script dependencies working again.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately,
        the open-source community and single-spa core team are very responsive to
        questions and <a href=\"https:\/\/single-spa.js.org\/help\/\">happy to help<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Next
        steps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the single-spa implementation complete, we\u2019ll
        be continuing our migration to React, and building new features, such as support
        for <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/lxd-4-0-lts-stable-release-is-now-available\">LXD
        VMs<\/a>. In the short to mid term, our intention is to migrate the entirety
        of the MAAS UI to React-Redux, however single-spa gives us the flexibility
        to adopt new tools should we need them in the future.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally,
        I\u2019d like to thank <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/joeldenning\">Joel
        Denning<\/a>, a tireless advocate for open-source and the single-spa project,
        for his kind support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A

        alt=\"An intro to MicroK8s\" class=\"wp-image-93762\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows
        and macOS developers can now use MicroK8s natively! Use kubectl at the Windows
        or Mac command line to interact with <a href=\"http:\/\/microk8s.io\">MicroK8s<\/a>
        locally just as you would on Linux. Clean integration into the desktop means
        better workflows to dev, build and test your containerised apps.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroK8s
        is a conformant upstream <a href=\"http:\/\/kubernetes.io\">Kubernetes<\/a>,
        packaged for simplicity and resilience. It provides sensible defaults and
        bundles the most commonly used components for at-your-fingertips access. A
        single-node install is one command and done in seconds, which makes it easy
        to add or remove from any system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroK8s is widely used by
        developers for local testing. After installing it, you can start and stop
        Kubernetes with a single command to conserve battery. With built-in GPGPU
        acceleration, Istio, Prometheus, Jaeger and many other popular services on
        tap, it serves as a complete workstation edition of K8s. All of this capability
        is now neatly accessible from the Windows and macOS command-line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroK8s
        is also popular for CI\/CD pipelines which create a fresh VM or cluster for
        each test run on demand. The simplicity of MicroK8s makes automation straightforward,
        and the speed of install reduces total test run times and resource consumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Windows<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        new installer for Windows is a standalone executable file, available from
        <a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/#get-started\">microk8s.io<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind
        the scenes, MicroK8s on Windows uses <a href=\"http:\/\/multipass.run\">Multipass<\/a>
        with Hyper-V or VirtualBox to drive a dedicated Linux VM that hosts your Kubernetes.
        MicroK8s on Windows does the work of starting, stopping and managing that
        VM and the Kubernetes itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        microk8s status --wait-ready<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice anything different? Yes,
        all MicroK8s commands now support a non-dotted format. So \u2018microk8s status\u2019
        and \u2018microk8s.status\u2019 are the same. This change is effective on
        Linux, Windows and macOS. The new version also supports the old dotted format
        for backwards compatibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/\">Get

        with other significant features too, such as Kubeflow 1.0 for AI\/ML research
        and development. Kubeflow manages data science pipelines on Kubernetes, with
        Tensorflow and other processing elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appliance, gadget
        makers and manufacturers increasingly want to use Kubernetes on their IoT
        or edge service. MicroK8s 1.18 introduced a snap interface that enables seamless
        interaction with other snap packages on the same host, giving them a local
        Kubernetes to drive. The Canonical&nbsp; support announcement for <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/kubernetes-1-18-available-from-canonical\">Kubernetes

        IoT devices expected to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/internet-of-things-report\">active
        by 2027<\/a>  \u2014 that\u2019s at least 5 devices for every person on the
        planet \u2014 edge computing has emerged as a tenable solution to prevent
        the impending snowballing of network traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allow me to lift
        the veil on this buzzword and explain why it\u2019s been gaining attention
        in tech circles lately.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The concept<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IoT
        devices generate a lot of data. Smart home hubs constantly accrue information
        on voice commands, ambient noise, and auxiliary device output. Connected security
        cameras transfer several gigabytes of image data each day. And self-driving
        cars will, in all likelihood, be gathering hundreds of terabytes of data each
        year.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of edge computing is to process all this
        data at the location it is collected. Data that is only of ephemeral importance
        can (and should) be crunched on the device itself. This is in contrast to
        cloud computing, where data is sent to massive, far-away compute warehouses
        for processing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/8b98\/iot-devices.png\"
        alt=\"Edge computing is a distributed architecture that processes data at
        the source itself.\" class=\"wp-image-95879\" width=\"565\" height=\"378\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite
        steady innovation in communication technology, traditional cloud computing
        is struggling to cater acceptable response times for devices operating at
        the fringes of a network. The rapid increase in IoT device adoption would
        also choke the bandwidths of existing network infrastructures.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edge
        computing tries to exploit chipsets at or close to the data source \u2014
        like those in smart appliances, mobiles phones and network gateways \u2014
        for performing computational tasks instead of aggregating all that work in
        a central cloud. This territorial proximity to the endpoint is good for both
        latency and efficiency, and it saves networks from unnecessary congestion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The
        benefits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So why all the hype? There are three key reasons
        why edge computing has become so popular in tech circles.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Furiously
        fast<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest advantage of an edge computing
        architecture is speed. For all the advancements in network engineering, physical
        distance still remains a key determinant in how quickly a server can process
        a user request. Waiting for data packets to travel to the cloud server, wait
        in a queue for crunching, and then travel back to the device with the right
        response is simply too prolonged a process.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several IoT
        use-cases cannot afford such delays. Fast-moving manufacturing robots, heavy
        mining machinery, smart grids managing traffic, and self-driving cars depend
        on virtually immediate responses to raw data for functioning safely and effectively.
        Leveraging device resources for data processing eliminates network latency
        from the equation and thus enables critical real-time applications, even in
        areas with spotty internet availability.<br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure
        class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/932f\/deltaupdates-1.png\"
        alt=\"5G is furiously fast\" class=\"wp-image-96090\" width=\"265\" height=\"151\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>At
        other times, the effects of speed are less critical to safety but are important
        for businesses anyway. Processing network requests even a couple of seconds
        faster demonstrably improves end-user experience, and gives products a competitive
        advantage.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/pixel\/pixel-visual-core-image-processing-and-machine-learning-pixel-2\/\">processes
        image data<\/a> from its Pixel smartphones directly on the device, allowing
        for snappier and more seamless camera interfaces. And AWS offers a globally
        distributed <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/cloudfront\/\">content delivery
        network<\/a> that caches media files at servers located closest to consumers,
        thus improving application loading speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Patently
        private<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit to keeping data at the edge
        is private. Many users get understandably uncomfortable sending their personal
        data to remote data stores which they cannot see or control. And transferring
        user data over (even secure) networks makes it vulnerable to theft and distortion.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These
        concerns can often be addressed by guaranteeing that a user\u2019s personal
        data never leaves the local device. Most famously, Apple jettisoned a bunch
        of criticism about its  <a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT204587\">security
        policy<\/a> by storing and authenticating a user\u2019s biometric information
        entirely on their edge device.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure
        class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/a9f0\/shields-security.png\"
        alt=\"5G is patently private\" class=\"wp-image-95903\" width=\"300\" height=\"171\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Conveniently
        cheap<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, there is a cost advantage to
        the edge paradigm. Moving processing resources to the network periphery is
        one of the few practical, cost-effective ways to handle the deluge of data
        springing from the predicted exponential increase in IoT usage.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        accordance with Moore\u2019s Law, small devices at the edge have become more
        computationally powerful. At the same time, costs associated with transferring
        and storing huge amounts of data have remained pretty much constant. If the
        trend is to continue, it is only inevitable that switching to an edge infrastructure
        would be a much cheaper solution for business enterprises in the long run
        than current cloud architectures.<br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure
        class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/admin.insights.ubuntu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/9c29\/save-time-money-icon-lrg.png\"
        alt=\"5G is conveniently cheap\" class=\"wp-image-96119\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Chipmakers
        are innovating fiercely in this field, releasing high-end GPU architectures
        that can handle increasingly complex operations at the edge. Just last year,
        Nvidia and Qualcomm respectively launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/en-us\/data-center\/products\/egx-edge-computing\/\">EGX<\/a>
        and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualcomm.com\/products\/vision-intelligence-400-platform\">Vision
        Intelligence Platforms<\/a> for enabling low-latency AI at the edge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The
        5G factor<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressing need for 5G in high growth areas like
        fully self-driving cars, real-time virtual reality experiences, and high-end
        multiplayer online gaming is further fueling innovation around edge computing.
        5G promises to significantly improve application performance across the board
        by offering 10x faster data rates than existing 4G networks.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edge
        computing remains a fundamental enabler of 5G, and is one of the rare mechanisms
        that can viably meet the speed, scale and safety requirements of 5G standards.
        Processing data streams at the edge can drop buffering times to virtually
        zero. Keeping customer data on the devices boosts security by reducing avenues
        for remote hacking. And the cost characteristics of edge computing allow companies
        to economically maximise the increase in connections that 5G networks can
        handle.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategically leveraging edge services can thus
        <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/bt-turns-to-canonical-ubuntu-to-enable-next-generation-5g-cloud-core\">help
        network providers<\/a> obtain a first-mover advantage in the disruptive 5G
        arena.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The framework<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Distributed edge
        infrastructures can quickly get out of hand. One needs a set of tools to easily
        deploy, manage and optimise network architectures with as little effort as
        possible. An open-source framework like <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/edgexfoundry\">EdgeX
        Foundry<\/a> running on Ubuntu is one of the quickest ways to start with edge
        computing.<br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter
        is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/readyspace.com.cn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/EdgeX_octopus_with_logo-1.png?w=1100&amp;ssl=1\"
        alt=\"EdgeX Foundry, the common framework for IoT edge computing.\" width=\"391\"
        height=\"353\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Frameworks are a great way to
        begin exploring a new technical concept. Launched in April 2017, EdgeX provides
        a platform for developers to build<a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/turning-your-raspberry-pi-4-into-an-edge-gateway-part-i\">
        custom IoT solutions<\/a>. The framework is essentially a collection of core
        microservices that provide a set of standard APIs which allow developers to
        easily build their applications, leveraging capabilities for local analytics,
        data filtering, transformation and export to the cloud.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EdgeX
        released its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linuxfoundation.org\/press-release\/2020\/05\/edgex-foundry-hits-major-milestone-with-5-million-container-downloads-and-a-new-release-that-simplifies-deployment-for-ai-data-analytics-and-digital-transformation\/\">latest
        version<\/a>, nicknamed Geneva (v1.2), earlier this month, which boasts more
        robust security, optimised analytics, and scalable connectivity across multiple
        devices.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The outro<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a given at this
        point that IoT depends on well-performing edge architectures to realise its
        full potential. But like many buzzwords, edge computing repackages a mature
        technical concept into a fashionable soundbite. Before the hype around cloud
        computing, most data processing did take place at the data source. That is,
        at what we now call the edge.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in a way, we are returning
        to a bygone paradigm to address the present limitations of the cloud. But
        this time, armed with novel tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/internet-of-things\">embedded
        OSs<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/internet-of-things\/gateways\">edge
        gateways<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/\">single node clusters<\/a>,
        we are better prepared to tackle the problem of scalable computing.<br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        that is to be consumed by another, \nwhether it be a library or some UI element,
        that consumer expects it to \nwork in a certain way every time they interact
        with it. All good \ndevelopers would agree and that\u2019s why we also write
        tests that either \nbreak our code up into chunks and test that each chunk
        works as \nexpected, unit tests, or test the entire lifecycle, end to end
        tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who has written unit tests for long enough knows
        that they are\n tedious to keep in sync with refactors and often end up taking
        a \ndisproportionate amount of time compared to the time it took to write
        \nthe functional code. I propose that that we focus less on unit tests and\n
        replace them with what I\u2019m calling the <strong>user contract<\/strong>
        of your code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"what-is-a-user-contract\">What is a user
        contract?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The consumer expects that when they perform action
        X, they receive \noutcome Y. Typically they are not concerned about how X
        became Y just \nthat it does so reliably. This is what I\u2019m calling the
        <strong>user contract<\/strong>.\n If we as the authors of the code take the
        same view from a testing \nperspective, it allows us to write simpler tests
        and gives us the \nability to refactor how a library or UI component works
        without having \nto update our tests, dramatically speeding up refactoring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While
        these examples are written in JavaScript the same techniques apply to all
        languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"library-example\">Library example<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting

        consumer of this API would have a couple expectations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>That
        function is asynchronous.<\/li><li>It returns a user list in a specific structure.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These
        expectations then outline what your tests are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>describe(''fetchUserList'',

        should note that we don\u2019t test any method that wasn\u2019t exported,
        nor do we export methods simply for testing purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To aid
        the user in understanding what this contract is you can \noutline it in the
        docblock for the exported function. This way it can be\n used to generate
        the documentation for your library and help outline \nwhat your test structure
        is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\/**\n  Returns a formatted
        user list.\n  @return {Object} The user list in the following format:\n  {

        type of database returning the user list, or the algorithm being used \nto
        format the user list you should not have to also modify your tests as\n the
        contract to your users has not changed. They still expect that if \nthey call
        <code>fetchUserList<\/code> they will receive the list in the specified format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4
        id=\"ui-example\">UI Example<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at a UI
        component this time using the React \njavascript library, in an effort to
        save space I\u2019ve removed the \nfunctions that aren\u2019t exported. This
        also helps to illustrate their \nirrelevance in our testing strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>export const LogIn = ({ children }) => {\n  const
        userIsLoggedIn = useSelector(isLoggedIn);\n  const userIsConnecting = useSelector(isConnecting);\n\n  const
        button = _generateButton(userIsConnecting);\n\n  if (!userIsLoggedIn) {\n    return
        (\n      &lt;>\n        &lt;div className=\"login\">\n          &lt;img className=\"login__logo\"
        src={logo} alt=\"logo\" \/>\n          {button}\n        &lt;\/div>\n        &lt;main>{children}&lt;\/main>\n      &lt;\/>\n    );\n  }\n  return
        children;\n};<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a fairly simple component that
        renders a \nlogin button with a logo. Let\u2019s go through the exercise and
        see what our\n User Contract is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If the user is not logged
        in\n<ul><li>It renders a logo and button to log in.<\/li><li>It renders any
        children passed to it.<\/li><li>clicking the button logs in.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/li><li>If
        the user is logged in\n<ul><li>It does not render a logo and button.<\/li><li>It
        renders any children passed to it.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our
        tests would be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>describe(''LogIn'',
        () => {\n  describe(''the user is not logged in'', () => {\n    it(''renders
        a logo and button to log in'');\n    it(''renders any children passed to it'');\n    it(''clicking
        the button logs in'');\n  });\n  describe(''the user is logged in'', () =>
        {\n    it(''does not render a logo and button to log in'');\n    it(''renders
        any children passed to it'');\n  });\n});<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing
        the returned value in a UI component is a \nlittle more nuanced than checking
        a return value of a library function. \nWe don\u2019t necessarily want to
        check every specific detail of each element\n returned unless it\u2019s part
        of the contract. I\u2019ll expand these tests with\n assertions but eschew
        the component setup and rendering in interest of \nspace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>it(''renders a logo and button to log in'',
        () => {\n  expect(wrapper.find(''.login__logo'').length).toBe(1);\n  expect(wrapper.find(''.login
        button'').length).toBe(1);\n);\nit(''renders any children passed to it'',
        () => {\n  expect(wrapper.find(''main .items'').length).toBe(3);\n});\nit(''logs
        the user in'', () => {\n  wrapper.find(''.login button'').simulate(''click'',
        {});\n  expect(useSelector(isLoggedIn)).toBe(true);\n});<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s
        important to note here that we have tried to \nlimit the specific details
        that aren\u2019t relevant to the contract of the \ncomponent. This allows
        the design to change and the contract to remain \nvalid and we do not need
        to update the tests. This is especially \nbeneficial when you have a shared
        component library within your company.\n You can update the designs and implementation
        details of your \ncomponents without updating the tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"what-if-i\">What
        if I\u2026<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\u2026want to test that an api call is being
        made with the correct signature?\n<ul><li>You should consider moving this
        sub api call into its own library and having it tested there. You&#8217;ll
        then be testing the <strong>user contract<\/strong> of this new library, that
        a call to your api is making a specific call to another api.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/li><li>\u2026have
        to mock out an api call?\n<ul><li>You\u2019ll find value in implementing a
        system that mocks out the layer \nwhich returns the data. In this layer it\u2019ll
        return a pre-defined set of \ndata depending on the arguments it receives.
        This way, if the arguments \never change and become invalid, it\u2019ll no
        longer return the correctly \nformatted outcome and your tests will fail.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/li><li>\u2026have
        a complex algorithm that needs testing?\n<ul><li>Consider moving this to a
        separate library and test it separately so that the <strong>user contract<\/strong>
        of that library is being tested.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/li><li>\u2026want to change
        the contract?\n<ul><li>You can release a major version bump of your code.

        versioning system<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When
        writing the code and exporting methods, ask yourself if the user\n needs to
        have access to this method or if you\u2019re only doing it for \ntesting purposes.
        You can always export more methods, you can\u2019t always \ntake exported
        methods away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When writing tests ask yourself how can the consumer
        interact with \nyour code and what type of outcome is expected for those interactions
        \nand them make sure you have those documented and assertions in your \ntests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t
        test implementation details of an exported method or UI component. Consider
        moving those to a different <strong>user contract<\/strong> if you feel they
        need direct testing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post originally appeared on: <a href=\"https:\/\/fromanegg.com\/post\/2020\/01\/01\/testing-your-user-contract\/\">https:\/\/fromanegg.com\/post\/2020\/01\/01\/testing-your-user-contract\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whenever
