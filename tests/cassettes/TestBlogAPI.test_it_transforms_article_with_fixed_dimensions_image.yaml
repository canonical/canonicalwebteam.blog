        am from a small island of Colombia in the Caribbean although I grew up in
        Barcelona, where I went to University to study Industrial Design Engineering.
        After my studies I lived briefly in Germany with the intention of learning
        the language, but 7 months after I got into a master\u2019s program at <a
        href=\"https:\/\/www.arts.ac.uk\/colleges\/central-saint-martins#\">Central
        Saint Martins<\/a> and moved to London. I have now been in London for 4 years<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides
        design I am really into politics and sociology, and spend a lot of my spare
        time listening to podcasts. My favourite podcasts are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wnycstudios.org\/podcasts\/radiolab\">Radiolab<\/a>
        and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com\/\">Talking Politics<\/a>,
        and I get my morning news from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/today-explained\">Today,
        Explained<\/a> from Vox and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/news\/series\/todayinfocus\">Today
        in Focus<\/a> from The Guardian.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Web squad<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our
        Web Squad develops and maintains most of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/search?q=topic%3Awebsite+org%3Acanonical-web-and-design&amp;type=Repositories\">Canonical\u2019s
        promotional sites<\/a> like <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/\">ubuntu.com<\/a>,
        <a href=\"https:\/\/canonical.com\/\">canonical.com<\/a> and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canonical
        partner programmes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This iteration we unveiled a new on canonical.com
        detailing <a href=\"https:\/\/canonical.com\/partners\">our partners programmes<\/a>,
        and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/canonical-web-and-design\/partners.ubuntu.com\/pull\/249\">redirected

        of partners.ubuntu.com (which is now just an API) to our <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/kubernetes\/features\">charmed
        Kubernetes<\/a> infrastructure and decommission the old infrastructure. We
        now have only 1 site remaining on the old infrastructure &#8211; assets.ubuntu.com

        touch-points, from web, documents, exhibitions, logos and video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brandstore
        demo<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We drew up our initial ideas into finished illustrations,

        2 videos for the Marketing Team in this iteration. We worked in collaboration
        with the PM\u2019s to create the 2 animated videos for a Microsoft event we
        are attending. The videos included VO\u2019s and some bespoke illustrations
        that we animated to create some real engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img

        layout &#8211; panels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This iteration we focused on panels
        within the new Vanilla Application Layout. We looked at behaviour, internal
        structure, adjusting to the needs of the content, positioning with respect
        to the elements that invoke the panel UI, attachment to one or more edges
        of the window and how this behaviour changes with increasing \/ decreasing

        we are working on design of application layouts and panels we started building
        a prototype implementation of the layout and its responsive behaviours. This
        allowed us to explore different ways of implementing desired positioning with
        CSS (fixed positioning, CSS Grid, etc) and verify the design assumptions.
        We also prototyped some more advanced interactions like resizing or aligning
        the panels to make sure our layout will be able to support them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        (in-app) so our users are aware of the bug fixes, security fixes, and new
        features in the most recent release. The up-coming version of MAAS UI will
        provide this announcement in app and admin users may opt out of this notification.

        process by doing a benchmarking of what other solutions of similar pages are
        on websites like Python, Go, ROS and Swift. Further to that, we will be doing
