        July 2020<\/strong>: Canonical, the publisher of <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/\">Ubuntu<\/a>,
        today announces the launch of its enhanced Global System Integrator (GSI)
        Programme. Alongside new partnership benefits, it includes resell and integration
        opportunities for the entirety of Canonical\u2019s secure, open source portfolio
        for the data centre, multi-cloud, edge and IoT. GSIs can now drive increased
        revenue by building customer solutions on an automated and scalable platform
        that accelerates time to market, decreases customer OPEX and delivers IT modernisation
        to their enterprise clients.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGSIs\nare at the forefront
        of bringing digital transformation to the\nenterprise in the form of best-fit
        solutions around AI, multi-cloud,\nhigh performance computing (HPC), IoT and
        intelligent automation. Our\nre-designed programme helps them to deliver this
        to customers\nquickly, securely and with better economics over a deployment\u2019s\nlifetime,\u201d
        said Regis Paquette, VP of Alliances at Canonical. \u201cGSIs\nincreasingly
        need to recommend, incorporate and deliver open source\ntechnologies to build
        bespoke solutions for enterprises while\naddressing their complex IT requirements.
        With this GSI programme,\nCanonical makes that process easy for them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A\nfull-stack

        options with the freedom to work across multiple IT\nenvironments, workloads,
        vendors and legacy infrastructure. GSIs can\nachieve reduced IT delivery times
        by accelerating deployments that\nnormally take months down to just hours.
        \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deployment\ncomplexity is simplified through Canonical\u2019s
        tools from bare metal\nto the application layer. This includes DevOps automation
        of apps and\ninfrastructure, cloud style provisioning of physical servers
        and apps\nthat can be built, published and updated remotely without the need\nfor
        manual intervention. With such tooling, GSIs can focus on\nconfiguration reuse,
        develop their organisational knowledge and thus,\nincrease customer satisfaction
        through quality deployments and\nimproved day-2 operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated\nGSI
        support and incentives<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical\nis rolling out
        additional benefits as part of the programme. GSIs can\ntake advantage of
        competitive pricing discounts upon deal\nregistration and aggregated volume
        discounts across their combined\ncustomer base. Technical teams can be certified
        both for first level\nsupport and delivery of all Canonical services. Canonical
        will also\nassign dedicated resources to GSIs including account management,\nsales,
        engineering and marketing support, in addition to a\ncomprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/canonical.com\/partners\/gsi?utm_campaign=PR\">partner\nportal.<\/a>\n\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As\npart
        of the programme, Canonical will engage with GSIs to train their\nsales and
        consulting teams on the value of Canonical\u2019s full suite,\nidentify integration
        opportunities with the GSIs own offering and\nwork together on specific customer

        enables Linux desktop app support with Flutter"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>By
        Chris Sells (Google) &amp; Ken VanDine (Canonical)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s
        goal for Flutter has always been to provide a portable framework for building
        beautiful UIs that run at native speeds no matter what platform you target.
        To validate this capability, we started by focusing on the mobile platforms,
        Android and iOS, where we\u2019ve seen more than 80,000 fast, beautiful Flutter
        apps published to Google Play.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To build on this success,
        for more than a year we\u2019ve been expanding our focus to include desktop-class
        experiences, both for the web and for the desktop OSes: macOS, Windows and
        Linux. This work includes extensive refactoring of the engine to support desktop-style
        mouse and keyboard input as well as resizable top-level windows. It also includes
        new UI capabilities that adapt well to desktop, like Material Density support
        and the NavigationRail and experiments with deep integration into the underlying
        desktop OS with experiments in Dart:FFI and access to the system menu bar
        and standard dialogs. All of this work was to ensure that in addition to being
        suitable for mobile-style experiences, Flutter is ready to handle full-featured,
        full-sized desktop apps.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has long been our vision for
        Flutter to power platforms. We\u2019ve seen this manifest already at Google
        with products like <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.googleblog.com\/2019\/05\/Flutter-io19.html\">the
        Assistant <\/a>so now we&#8217;re thrilled to see others harnessing Flutter
        to power more platforms. Today we are happy to jointly announce the availability
        of the Linux alpha for Flutter alongside Canonical, the publisher of <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/\">Ubuntu<\/a>,
        the world\u2019s most popular desktop Linux distribution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why
        Flutter for Linux?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, when Google announced desktop-class
        application support with Flutter, Canonical saw an exciting opportunity to
        make Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, an attractive target platform
        for Flutter app developers. Flutter\u2019s native cross-platform story is
        growing rapidly and Canonical wanted to be at the vanguard. By enabling desktop
        Linux support in Flutter, Canonical is making it very easy for application
        developers to publish their apps for Linux users via the Snap Store, the app
        store for Linux. By making Linux a first class Flutter platform, Canonical
        is inviting application developers to publish their apps to millions of Linux
        users and broaden the availability of high quality applications available
        to them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a number of things about Flutter that
        were exciting for Canonical:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fast growing ecosystem of
        application developers<\/li><li>Multiple platform support<\/li><li>Highly
        optimised native applications<\/li><li>Modern UI framework supporting declarative,
        reactive and composable widgets<\/li><li>Rich development platform using Visual
        Studio Code, Android Studio and IntelliJ<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s
        initial announcement started with an alpha release supporting macOS and plans
        for Linux and Windows. Canonical is making a significant investment in Flutter
        by dedicating a team of developers to work alongside Google\u2019s developers
        to bring the best Flutter experience to the majority of Linux distributions.
        Canonical will continue to collaborate with Google to further improve Linux
        support and maintain feature parity with the other supported platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flokk:
        Proving Flutter\u2019s readiness for the desktop<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To demonstrate
        that Flutter was ready for the desktop, we worked with the designers and developers
        at <a href=\"http:\/\/gskinner.com\/\">gskinner.com<\/a> to create an innovative,
        beautiful Flutter desktop app. Flokk is a real-world app that works with real-world
        data, specifically your Google Contacts list. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube

        addition to innovating in the social space, Flokk uses Flutter features to
        look and feel great. As just one example, the dark theme not only switches
        the colors but animates the changes as it does so.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        app runs fantastically. Working with the Canonical team was a wonderful experience;
        they were enthusiastic, engaged, and passionate about making Flutter better
        not just for Linux, but for every platform. It was an amazing project, and
        I\u2019m thrilled to be able to target another major OS with Flutter.\u201d

        Flokk app on your Linux machine, you can download the latest release on <a
        href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/gskinnerTeam\/Flokk\/releases\">GitHub<\/a>.
        Or, if you\u2019re running snapd, you can download the Flokk App from the
        <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/flokk-contacts\">Snap Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Easy
        install of Flutter on Linux<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve seen how
        well Flutter works for desktop-class applications, especially on Linux, you\u2019re
        going to want to get it running on your own Linux machine. To make that as
        simple as possible, we\u2019re pleased to provide the Flutter SDK for Linux
        as a snap in the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/flutter\">Snap Store.<\/a>
        The Flutter SDK snap provides everything needed to develop Flutter apps on
        your favorite Linux distribution. No need to install a bunch of development
        dependencies; simply install the Flutter SDK snap and your favorite IDE and
        you have everything you need to create, build and publish your applications
        for Linux.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you would like to get started
        developing Flutter applications for Linux and your IDE of choice is Visual
        Studio Code, this is all you need to do at your Linux terminal:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ snap install --classic flutter<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ snap install --classic code<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ code --install-extension dart-code.flutter<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If
        you also want to use Linux to develop mobile apps, you can do so by installing
        the Android SDK or Android Studio (which includes the Android SDK). For more
        information on the Flutter SDK as a snap, see <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/flutter\">https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/flutter<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flutter
        for Linux desktop<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have the Flutter SDK installed
        on your Linux machine, to build a desktop app, you need to access the Flutter
        dev (or the master) channel and to enable Linux desktop support:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ flutter channel dev<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$
        flutter upgrade<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ flutter
        config --enable-linux-desktop<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now when you create a new
        Flutter project, you\u2019ll get a Linux subdirectory that will enable you
        to run as a desktop app that runs on your Linux machine:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ flutter create counter<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ cd counter<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$
        flutter run -d linux<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/cEyBMSXjosymswv1yeaBbJynlJPN1GZ0EqRiWAIOqZRPoPdwq16khbiSjwiJofPua9AfWv1t9zluDBEPelEVPTsAk5HvfGzgGVhFsJGwleC12mEQezjCV-sBMJ6m50XiCu-gy8tq42qNt9Qu3w\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What you\u2019ll get is a shiny new Linux
        app built with Flutter running on the latest stable version of GTK+. If you
        have an existing Flutter project to which you\u2019d like to add Linux support
        after you have Linux enabled, you can add the Linux subfolder like so:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ cd my_flutter_app<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$
        flutter create .<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This will create the Linux subfolder
        with the Runner project that you need to build and run your Flutter app on
        the Linux desktop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessing native code in Linux from Flutter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        addition to supporting the desktop by writing Dart to create Flutter widgets,
        your Linux desktop apps can also access all of native Linux using <a href=\"https:\/\/flutter.dev\/docs\/development\/platform-integration\/platform-channels\">platform
        channels<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/dart.dev\/guides\/libraries\/c-interop\">the
        Dart Foreign Function Interface for C\/C++<\/a>. Or, if you\u2019d like to
        reuse pre-existing code, you can <a href=\"http:\/\/pub.dev\/flutter\/packages?platform=linux\">find
        that code on pub.dev<\/a>, Dart and Flutter\u2019s package manager site. Most
        of the packages you\u2019ll find on pub.dev will be pure Dart, most of which
        will work just fine in your Linux app. Some packages, called plugins, have
        native code in them that are specific to one or more platforms. As part of
        this release, we\u2019ve published three plugins on pub.dev that use native
        functionality of Linux:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/pub.dev\/packages\/url_launcher\">url_launcher<\/a>:
        launch the default browser at a URL provided<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/pub.dev\/packages\/shared_preferences\">shared_preferences<\/a>:
        user preferences shared between app sessions<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/pub.dev\/packages\/path_provider\">path_provider<\/a>:
        path information about special-purpose folders, e.g. downloads, pictures,
        etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these plugins is available for you to use
        in your apps as well as examples of how to access Linux natively from your
        Flutter code, like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/flutter\/plugins\/tree\/master\/packages\/url_launcher\/url_launcher_linux\/\">the
        Linux implementation of url_launcher<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deploying to the
        Snap Store<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To deploy your Flutter app to the Snap Store, you\u2019ll
        first need to install Snapcraft, the tool that you will use to build and publish
        your application as a snap:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$
        sudo snap install snapcraft --classic<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To drive the Snapcraft
        tool, you\u2019ll need to create a snapcraft.yaml file in your app\u2019s
        project folder. As one example, this is the one for Flokk:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">name: flokk-contacts<br>version: 1.0.0<br>summary:
        Flokk Contacts<br>description: A fresh and modern Google Contacts manager
        that integrates with GitHub and Twitter.<br>confinement: strict<br>base: core18<br>grade:
        stable<br><br>apps:<br>   flokk-contacts:<br>     command: flokk-contacts<br>     extensions:
        [flutter-master]<br>     plugs:<br>       - network<br><br>parts:<br>  flokk-contacts:<br>    source:
        .<br>    plugin: flutter<br>    flutter-target: lib\/main.dart # The main
        entry-point file of the application<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the folder with your
        snapcraft.yaml file, you can now run snapcraft to build a snap of your application.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ snapcraft<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If all goes
        well, this will produce a file in your current working directory like &#8220;flokk-contacts_1.0.0_amd64.snap&#8221;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once
        you&#8217;ve <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/creating-your-developer-account\">setup
        your account<\/a> for publishing in the Snap Store, you\u2019re now ready
        to publish your snap:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$
        snapcraft login<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ snapcraft
        register flokk-contacts #(registers the snap name in the store, these must
        be unique)<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ snapcraft
        upload flokk-contacts_1.0.0_amd64.snap --release edge&nbsp;<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        will upload it to the Snap Store and attempt to publish it to the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/channels#heading--risk-levels\">edge
        channel<\/a>. Once your application is published in the edge channel it can
        be installed either via the Snap Store Desktop client or using the command
        line:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">$ snap install
        --edge flokk-contacts<br><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details on building your
        first snap and publishing it in the Snap Store, see <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/first-snap#flutter\">https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/first-snap#flutter<\/a>
        for a guided tutorial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flutter Linux desktop samples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Flokk Contacts app is an excellent example of a real-world Flutter app targeting
        the Linux desktop. For a simpler sample, you can check out <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/flutter\/samples\/tree\/master\/experimental\/desktop_photo_search\">the
        Photo Search app<\/a>, which was also built specifically to show off desktop
        features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/s_hYnCpVTFD-xrcr1yWgoHa_f0I4U62D5UdSuqxq9pQh-qkHQAtq8lueSykcX3wrdf6PcMyV7wbXCxQ2honfm2kRSmcx0Pqf2vFefgc--kCctE_5HU-zfmqqKeGE7d4uOKlTH6ynrDcgcLDM4g\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo Search is a simple online photo search
        app that uses several plugins to access native platform functionality, supporting
        both macOS and Linux.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an example of a Linux desktop app
        with step-by-step instructions, I recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/codelabs.developers.google.com\/codelabs\/flutter-github-graphql-client\/index.html#0\">the
        Write a Flutter desktop application codelab<\/a>, which walks you through
        using OAuth and GraphQL to build a GitHub client in Flutter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        that exercises much more of the surface area of Flutter as well as providing
        several little applets, then I recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/flutter\/gallery\">the
        Flutter Gallery<\/a>, which was redesigned last year to support desktop as
        well as mobile. If you\u2019d like to see that in action, you can check that

        HPC DevOps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many High Performance Computing (HPC) setups are
        still handcrafted configurations where tuning changes can take days or weeks.
        This is because the more you tune and optimise something, the more bespoke
        and unique it is, and the more unique something is, the lower the chances
        that things will just work out of the box, and HPC is no exception.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A
        new school of HPC<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now physical servers are a lot easier to
        set up, provision and configure thanks to tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/maas.io\/\">MAAS<\/a>.
        For example, connecting servers and selecting which ones will be configured
        for networking and which for data, is as easy as clicking a button on a web
        UI. This may seem innocuous but it means that a server farm can be used for
        one project in the morning and for something completely different in the afternoon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        reality, the server configuration is only the start, the base from which everything
        bubbles up. Re-configuration at the server level allows for use of higher-level
        tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/blog\/maas-2-8-new-features\">LXD
        VMs<\/a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/kubernetes\">Kubernetes<\/a>
        and <a href=\"https:\/\/jaas.ai\/\">Juju<\/a> to quickly put together an environment
        with reusable code without needing to be a DevOps expert or having to wait
        for an expert to do it for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we are going to
        see in the next few years is a growth of HPC with cloud native tools. Or,
        in other words, bringing cloud software tools and good developer experience
        into the world of HPC to make the operations easier.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What
        next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A cloud-native experience in HPC is not a new idea [<a
        href=\"https:\/\/www.hpcwire.com\/solution_content\/ibm\/cross-industry\/bridging-hpc-and-cloud-native-development-with-kubernetes\/\">1<\/a>,

        but has been thrust into the limelight given the recent need for more scientific
        work being done in the fight against COVID-19. In these real-life applications
        what matters is no longer the \u2018wall time\u2019 the software takes from
        start to finish but rather the time the overall project takes to reach a practical
        conclusion, factoring in human time and operational processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern
        cloud-native software can help with time to delivery. If you are interested

        <\/strong>Over the past year the Roblox Traffic Engineering team has been
        planning a migration to open source load balancing. The goal is to provide
        an infinitely scalable, globally available, high performance solution. The
        rollout of this solution was supposed to happen over the course of a year.
        However, due to Covid-19 <a href=\"https:\/\/roblox.fandom.com\/wiki\/Project:Home\">Roblox<\/a>
        needed to scale up rapidly to meet the extra demand of their user base. With
        much of the world under quarantine, children are turning to Roblox to fill

        practices for an effective remote team in the world of cloud delivery"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Just
        like countless other business functions, cloud delivery has now shifted entirely
        to remote working for now and perhaps longer term. Canonical has been a remote-first
        company for some time, so we thought we\u2019d take this opportunity to share
        some of the best practices we\u2019ve learned along the way.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Communication<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective
        communication between customers, engineers, and project managers is the most
        critical element of successful cloud delivery. This has always been the case,
        but it is doubly important in the absence of regular, face-to-face contact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        remote teams, instant messaging is an invaluable tool. Internally, we use
        instant messaging both to keep in touch with one another and to coordinate
        on projects. However, it\u2019s important to keep these two purposes separate.
        Maintaining one social channel and one business-focused channel prevents casual
        conversation from disrupting work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For communication with customers,
        the use of email is the standard tool. Indeed, official design decisions should
        not be made lightly and need to be documented. In order to avoid delays and
        have everyone stick to action points, we make sure to chase up through phone
        or message, but always need to communicate through email. This helps ensure
        that both parties stay up-to-date on a project\u2019s status and that we have
        written confirmations.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Documented, time zone-agnostic
        processes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical\u2019s Project Management team
        was well prepared for the full-scale shift to remote working because we already
        had a comprehensive Standard Operating Guide in place. The SOG lays out step-by-step
        instructions for each of our internal processes, so even if a team member
        has never performed a task before, they can see exactly what they need to
        do without having to consult a colleague.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing operational
        guidelines for a global, remote team, the key is to ensure that processes
        are consistent, centrally documented, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 asynchronous.
        This means that team members should be able to collaborate across time zones
        without imposing delays on one another. Time zone-agnostic processes can be
        achieved using real-time systems for project management, and shared, cloud-based
        documents rather than local files.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Virtual sprints<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team
        sprints, which enable teams to collaborate, review and complete work in a
        short period of time,&nbsp; are a core component of agile project management,
        compressing weeks or months of work into just a few days. Given the intense
        and collaborative nature of sprints, they typically take place in person \u2013
        but remote sprints are now a very real possibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual
        sprints offer a considerably different experience to their traditional counterparts,
        and they can be highly effective. While an on-site sprint contains a certain
        aspect of relationship building, a virtual sprint is all about tangible results.
        Teams can be more focused on the work, and will often achieve outcomes that
        would not be possible in an office environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mini team sprints
        are particularly well-suited to remote teams. Pulling together multiple people
        for an entire week can be challenging \u2013 especially if the sprint involves
        customer employees \u2013 but it\u2019s much easier to schedule four hours
        of intense collaboration on a hyper-specific objective. And remote working
        enables the team to focus on that objective with minimal distraction.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn

        Center for Internet Security, Inc (CIS \u00ae) is a community-driven nonprofit
        organization for defining best-practice security guidance. CIS is perhaps
        most well-known for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisecurity.org\/controls\/cis-controls-list\/\">CIS
        Top 20 Controls<\/a>, a prioritized list of actions to protect against well-known
        cyber attack vectors. CIS also publishes over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisecurity.org\/cis-benchmarks\/cis-benchmarks-faq\/\">100
        benchmarks<\/a>. These community driven configuration recommendations define
        baseline safeguards to protect against cyber threats. A community of technology
        professionals maintain each benchmark and balance security goals against operational
        needs. The CIS benchmarks have become a de facto response to the question
        &#8220;are you following a best practice security configuration?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benchmarks
        leave plenty of room for local customization. An organization will tailor
        the benchmark to match their organizational policy. In addition, highly specific
        settings such as firewall policies are not defined within the benchmark. Instead,
        the benchmark recommends enabling the feature but defers the actual configuration
        details to local policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Top 20 Controls and all the benchmarks
        are freely accessible from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisecurity.org\/cis-benchmarks\/\">CIS

        greatest opportunity to secure existing robots. The current benchmark is built
        upon the existing Ubuntu benchmark, which in turn is based on the Debian benchmark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The

        July 31st, Canonical&#8217;s panel of experts come together to share their
        insights from years of working with developers and enterprises on various
        Kubernetes use cases and interact with the audience live.<br><br><br>For all
        the benefits it offers around container orchestration, Kubernetes remains
        a significantly complex platform to deploy and operate. As developers and
        enterprises alike turn to Kubernetes for more and more types of use cases,
        available Kubernetes solutions often fail to meet their exact needs. Canonical\u2019s
        extensive Kubernetes portfolio is centered around Charmed Kubernetes and MicroK8s,
        designed to provide full flexibility from cloud to edge in order to facilitate
        efficient innovation and scaling.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the event about?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        this virtual event, Canonical\u2019s panel of experts will discuss tools and
        strategies for:<br><br>&#8211; Optimising economics from cloud to edge<br>&#8211;
        Streamlining deployment and operation of Kubernetes clusters<br>&#8211; Lowering
        barriers to entry for Kubernetes in resource-limited environments<br>&#8211;
        Leveraging Canonical&#8217;s extensive Kubernetes portfolio, centred around
        Charmed Kubernetes and MicroK8s<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who are the speakers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        this event, we will be bringing in a panel of Canonical&#8217;s most knowledgable
        people for the topic and region addressed. These are:<br><br>&#8211; Michaels
        Iatrou, Director of Field Engineering (Americas)<br>&#8211; Tim van Steenburgh,
        Engineering Manager (Kubernetes)<br>&#8211; Sohini Roy, Product Manager <br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join
        them as they incorporate your questions and topics of interest in their discussion
        live, delve into practical examples they\u2019ve experienced through their

        puts a strong focus on the migration from ROS to ROS 2. ROS 2 benefits from
        many improvements, especially robot security. Our goal is to make it easy
        for you to transition to ROS 2, whether you&#8217;re completely new to ROS
        or a seasoned engineer retooling for a new environment. Your new platform
        should be secure-by-default, and we expect you&#8217;ll need to pivot between
        different environments as you migrate from ROS to ROS 2.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along
        the way we&#8217;ve encountered some friction points, some mild surprises,
        and some opportunities to better leverage existing tools. Whenever that happened
        we tried to fix them and share our experiences so you didn&#8217;t run into
        the same problems! This has resulted in blog posts and videos in three key
        focus areas: getting started with ROS 2, software development in ROS 2, and
        building snaps for ROS.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s recap some of our recent output.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting

        operating system for use in the cloud.  Every day millions of Ubuntu instances
        are launched in private and public clouds around the world. Canonical takes
        pride in offering support for the latest cloud features and functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        of today, all Ubuntu Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace listings are now
        updated to include support for the new Graviton2 instance types. <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ec2\/graviton\/\">Graviton2<\/a>  is
        Amazon\u2019s next-generation ARM processor delivering increased performance
        at a lower cost. This announcement includes three new  instances types:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>M6g
        for general-purpose workloads with a balance of CPU, memory, and network resources<\/li><li>C6g
        for compute-optimized workloads such as encoding, modeling, and gaming<\/li><li>R6g
        for memory-optimized workloads, which process large datasets in memory like
        databases<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Users on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) can take
        advantage of additional optimizations found on newer ARM-based processors.
        The large-system extensions (LSE) are enabled by using the included libc6-lse
        package,  which can result in orders of magnitude performance improvements.
        Ubuntu  18.04 LTS (Bionic) will shortly be able to take advantage of this
        change as well. Additionally, Amazon will soon launch instances with locally
        attached NVMe storage called M6gd, C6gd, and R6gd. With these instance types,
        users can further increase performance with additional low-latency, high-speed
        storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launch Ubuntu instances on the AWS Marketplace today:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a

        to manage snap updates"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Updates are an integral
        part of the software lifecycle. Quite often, they bring improvements, vital
        security patches &#8211; and sometimes, unfortunately, bugs, too. In mission-critical
        environments, it is important to assert a high degree of oversight and precision
        over updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snaps come with a built-in automatic update mechanism,
        whereby snaps are refreshed to a new version whenever there\u2019s a new release
        in the Snap Store. Typically, the refresh occurs four times a day, and in
        the vast majority of cases, they will complete seamlessly, without any issues.
        However, there are cases when and where snap updates need to be deferred or
        postponed, or simply managed with a greater, more refined level of control.
        There are several ways the users can achieve that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Snap (refresh)
        control<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The snap updates schedule is governed by four system-wide
        options. These include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Refresh.timer &#8211; Defines
        the refresh frequency and schedule. You can use this parameter to set when
        the snaps will refresh, so this does not conflict with your other activities
        &#8211; like work meetings, data backups, or similar.<\/li><li>Refresh.hold
        &#8211; Delays the next refresh until the defined time and date. The hold
        option allows you to postpone updates for up to 60 days. In combination with
        the timer option, you can set very specific time windows for when the snaps
        are updated.<\/li><li>Refresh.metered &#8211; Pauses refresh updates when
        the network connection is metered. By default, snap refresh is enabled over
        metered connections. However, to conserve data, you can pause the refreshes
        on such networks.<\/li><li>Refresh.retain &#8211; Sets how many revisions
        of a snap are stored on the system. By default, the last three revisions of
        the installed snap will be kept.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of
        these four factors gives users quite a fair bit of flexibility in how they
        control the snap updates. In particular, the timer and hold can be used to
        create set windows for updates, allowing you to perform any necessary pre-
        and post-update tasks, like functionality checks, data backups, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>The
        time-snap continuum<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s have a look at some practical
        examples. For instance, you may want to set your snap updates only to run
        overnight, between 01:00 and 02:00 (in the 24h format).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo
        snap set system refresh.timer=01:00-02:00<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After you set the
        schedule window, you can check what the system reports:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap
        refresh --time<br>timer: 01:00-02:00<br>last: today at 12:38 PST<br>next:
        tomorrow at 01:00 PST<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/docs\/keeping-snaps-up-to-date\">quite
        a few variations available<\/a>, including the ability to set the schedule
        at specific hours or time windows for each day of the week, you can omit some
        days, and you can also set in which particular week of a month you may want
        to run the update. You can use values 1-4, e.g.: mon3 will be the third Monday
        of the month, while 5 denotes the last week in the month, as no Earthly calendar
        currently has more than 31 days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting the hold interval
        takes a specific date format, as it needs to conform to RFC 3339. This may
        sound like a page straight out of the Vogon book on time management, so you
        can use the following command to convert dates into the right format:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">date --date=\"TMZ YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%:z<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>For
        instance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">date --date=\"PST
        2020-08-01 13:00:00\" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%:z<br>2020-08-01T13:00:00+01:00<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then,
        you can set the refresh value with the formatted date string:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo snap set system refresh.hold=2020-08-01T13:00:00+01:00<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo snap get system refresh.hold<br>2020-08-01T13:00:00+01:00<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once
        the refresh hold is in place, you can check the refresh schedule:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap refresh --time<br>timer: 01:00-02:00<br>last:
        today at 12:38 PST<br>hold: in 31 days, at 13:00 PST<br>next: tomorrow at
        01:00 PST (but held)<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the information now
        combines parameters both from the timer and hold settings. The next update
        is meant to be tomorrow at 01:00, as defined by the timer, but it will be
        held &#8211; for 31 days &#8211; until the update deferment expires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly,
        you can configure the updates on metered connections. Setting the value to
        <em>hold<\/em> will prevent updates, while changing the value to <em>null<\/em>
        will allow updates to resume.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo
        snap set system refresh.metered=hold<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo
        snap set system refresh.metered=null<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, you can combine
        this option with the timer and hold settings to create a granular and precise
        update schedule that will not interfere with your critical tasks, ensure maximum
        consistency, and also allow you to receive the necessary functional and security
        patches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, occasionally, you may want to check which snaps
        will update on next refresh. This will give you an indication of the pending
        list of new snap revisions your system will receive:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap
        refresh --list<br>Name &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version&nbsp; Rev&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Publisher &nbsp; Notes<br>lxd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        16044&nbsp; canonical\u2713&nbsp; -<br>snapcraft&nbsp; 4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        5143 &nbsp; canonical\u2713&nbsp; classic<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the full list
        of installed snaps is longer. For example, the system currently has lxd version
        4.2 installed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap list
        lxd<br>Name&nbsp; Version&nbsp; Rev&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracking &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Publisher &nbsp; Notes<br>lxd &nbsp; 4.2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15878&nbsp;
        latest\/stable&nbsp; canonical\u2713&nbsp; -<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h1>Refresh awareness<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>This
        is <a href=\"https:\/\/snapcraft.io\/blog\/experimental-feature-snap-refresh-awareness-and-update-inhibition\">another
        feature<\/a> that you can use to control the updates. In some cases, you may
        be running a vital task that must not be interrupted in any way. To that end,
        you can use refresh awareness to make sure the application will not be updated
        while running. If you try to run a manual snap update while it\u2019s running
        (and you\u2019re using the awareness feature), you will see a message like
        below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">snap refresh okular
        --candidate<br>error: cannot refresh \"okular\": snap \"okular\" has running
        apps (okular)<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h1>Summary<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Automatic updates
        can never be a blanket solution for all use cases. Desktop, server and IoT
        environments all have their particular requirements and sensitivity, which
        is why snapd comes with a fairly extensive update control mechanism. The combination
        of timed schedules, update delay of up to 60 days, metered connections functionality,
        and snap refresh awareness and update inhibition offer a wide and pragmatic
        range of options and settings, through which the users can create a robust,
        reliable software update regime. Furthermore, business customers can configure
        their own <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.ubuntu.com\/snap-store-proxy\/en\/\">snap
        store proxy.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, this article clears some of the
        fog surrounding snap updates, and what users can do with them. If you have

        (HA) for <a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/\">MicroK8s<\/a>, the lightweight
        Kubernetes, is now available as a tech preview for Linux, Windows and macOS.
        The Kubernetes control plane can now be distributed across multiple nodes,
        bringing resiliency to the cluster while maintaining a low footprint using
        <a href=\"https:\/\/dqlite.io\/\">Dqlite<\/a>, the distributed SQL engine
        as the Kubernetes datastore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Linux, you can download and
        test highly available MicroK8s from the &#8216;ha-preview&#8217; branch:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre
        class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=latest\/edge\/ha-preview<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If
        you already have MicroK8s, learn how to upgrade to the ha-preview channel
        and set up your MicroK8s HA cluster in the <a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/docs\/high-availability\">MicroK8s
        HA documentation<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to test the HA feature
        on <a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/docs\/install-alternatives#heading--windows\">Windows<\/a>
        and <a href=\"https:\/\/microk8s.io\/docs\/install-alternatives#heading--macos\">macOS<\/a>,
        follow the corresponding installation instructions and run the following command
        after the installation is complete:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">multipass
        exec microk8s -- sudo snap refresh microk8s --classic --channel=latest\/edge\/ha-preview<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note
        that the ha-preview version comes with the high availability feature enabled
        by default. This means that adding at least two nodes to the cluster will
        automatically form a highly available control plane across the three nodes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once
        you have added the additional nodes to the HA cluster, microk8s status output
        will look like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BK_midVQ_jKcl-mGyk3dMa7kxNOJHUTxL1VYAQMUOGm4bMzI3WPwwWhQWpkYvrkCYPiETUscamnqxm2ENc2DlG4fOYV0YTLsdSk9uxlA7pXVb9OOWvcUJpzYgMtTGJNzOwI3evio\"

        with custom cloud-init UI<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our cloud-init designs have been
        finalised and are currently in development, stay tuned for MAAS 2.9. The goal
        of this feature is to create parity with our API.\u00a0 You will be able to

        of React migration project is merely focussed on KVM; KVM listing and KVM
        details. In our earlier design work, we have been exploring different ways
        to represent KVM resources data in order to reflect the truth and minimise
        confusion.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/Yt6T9wN989JZfGQFo00cPERweiLF4QWtAalMHcMq2MK5QgAoH98Vm4Jk1lXBxbKd-OVyqcbyUwY8wxHpg5ys2IIYMPfc1pDxJ2ws_-BJ-QxkK0XvRY7x0I5hg0GnfEMAO-v3w7ga\"
        alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that we discovered from
        our user interviews is that the word \u201cused\u201d vs \u201cavailable\u201d
        created confusion for our users. Because our users interpreted these resources
        as actually used. Whereas in reality, the data represented here is the amount
        of resources that our users assigned to their KVMs.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The
        concept of overcommit still remains as a big design challenge for our team.
        The current solution that we choose is to make the information expander clearer
        and add visual cues to help highlight the important aspects of KVM resources.
        The bigger question we want to answer is how might we show these graphs in
        ways that are useful and accurate?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In-app release notification
        on the way<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our data has shown that about less than 10% of
        our users updated MAAS to the newest version of MAAS in the past releases.
        So our goal is to expand the announcement channel to MAAS-app to help promote
        our new release. For MAAS 2.9 our goal is to create the simplest version of
        the notification component for new release announcements and from here we
        will try to see this as a starting point to scale our notifications forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>JAAS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The

        the display property<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We updated our web-font loading strategy,
        so now our Ubuntu web-font is optional on the first load. This improves page
        loading performance by not making the browser wait for the font files to be
        downloaded before it can render the text. The first load of the page (if the
        web-font is not yet cached) will render with fallback font, but any later
        visit will use Ubuntu web-font downloaded in the background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure
